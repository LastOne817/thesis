\label{section:problem}

Vulnerability requires three elements: a flaw in system, accessibility to the flaw, and capability to exploit the flaw.
In this paper, I focus on inherent vulnerabilities in software such as memory corruption.

I aim to detect software vulnerability with sufficient accuracy and granularity in moderate execution time.
Although existing methods have achieved efficiency to some extent, each has their own limitations which will be described in the following section.
