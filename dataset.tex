\section{Dataset}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Dataset is an important part of learning our model.

\item
In order to detect vunlerability with function-level granularity and to classify them with type,
we need each function labeled either secure or not, and with type of vulnerability if insecure.

\item
Despite the number of available source codes, labeling them is challenging.

\item
We collected pull requests of which title containing vulnerability type, e.g. buffer overflow, from Github and labeled merged commit as secure and base commit as vulnerable.
