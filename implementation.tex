\section{Implementation}

We implemented vulnerability detection model as convolutional neural network.
Dataset of source codes are first converted by Joern \cite{YamGolArpRie14}.
Joern generates code property graph from C/C++ source code repository.
Generated graphs include not only AST, CFG, and PDG, but also nodes and edges describing file and directory structure of source code.
Thus we parsed them to contain only useful information, only including code section relevant to vulnerability and excluding irrelevant attributes.
The following stages of learning are implemented as same as PATCHY-SAN \cite{niepert2016learning}.
