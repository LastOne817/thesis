\section{Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}

We implemented vulnerability detection model as convolutional neural network.
Dataset of source codes are first converted by Joern \cite{yamaguchi2014modeling}.
Joern generates code property graphs from each C/C++ source code repository.
Since feeding the whole repository is inefficient, I parsed them to contain relevant code sections which are diffs between base and merged commit.
The following stages of learning are implemented as same as PATCHY-SAN \cite{niepert2016learning}.
