\section{Background}

In this section, we provide background knowledge about vulnerability and neural network which is also known as deep learning.

\subsection{Vulnerability}

Vulnerability is a weakness in a system which can be exploited by an attacker.
Although current researches detecting vulnerabilty, bug, and malware share many approaches and techniques in common,
there are critical difference that should be distinguished between them.
While bug simply means a system flaw, vulnerability also requires access to such flaw and capability exploit it.
Vulnerability also differs from malware. Malware is a malicious software which is intended to be hostile,
while vulnerability is basically an unintended flaw in naive software.
In this paper we focus on inherent vulnerabilities in software such as memory corruption.
