\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, I suggest vulnerability detection model that using deep learning to detect vulnerabilities efficiently and effectively.
Detection model combines code property graph as a comprehensive representation and convolutional neural network for graph data to process the code property graph.
Evaluation of this model is left for future work.
Furthermore, other detection models with different learning models must be compared.
